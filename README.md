## Reversi-bwcore

A simple but relative strong Reversi(Othello) bot running on [botzone.org](https://botzone.org)

version: 1.5.2

For detail rule and introduction of the game, see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi).

### Usage

#### requirements

* g++ >= 7

  These code was developed under g++17. minGW-w64 is suggested on Windows.

* Python3

  Some simple scripts including `tools/merge.py` `tools/match.py`requires Python3.

* A modern x86-64 CPU

  A little assembly instructions are used to speed up board operation.

#### build

* Generate botzone single file program

  Run `make botzone` , it will call `tools/merge.py` to merge useful source files in  `/src` into botzone.cpp, and try to build it.

  `make online` will build same program, but it is built by multiple files. 

* Run a simple console UI on Windows

  Run `make` , then there will be a bwcore1.5.exe, it can run directly under cmd.exe, you can play game by clicking mouse. See `src/cui.cpp` if it can't display properly.

* Run keyboard interaction mode

  Run `make test` and `test.exe`, you can test bot by keyboard commands, there are some commands for debug, see [docs/TODO.md](doc/bwcore_TODO.md)

  Specially, run `test.exe --` will do some basic test

* Match between two bots

  1. Get any Reversi bot supporting Botzone keep running mode, for bwcore1.5 is `make online` or `make botzone` 
  2. Run `make judger` Make a Reversi judger, `src/judger.cpp` is a simple judger only support Botzone simplified interaction format
  3. Run `python tools.py <bot1> <bot2> <n_games> `, then result will be saved into `match.log` after all match game finish

* Generate selfplay data

  Run `make gendata` , board evaluation data can be generated by bwcore1.5 selfplay. Further more, you can modify `src/gendata.cpp` to generate learning data as you like.

* Debug

  When building all binaries above, add `make debug=1` to build with debug flag, then the code will not be optimized. bwcore1.5 will also do some assertion check when running under debug mode.
